## This is my first try pushing a **file** to Github

Its just a simple **Credit Card Checker** program 
* using some basic coding statements like :
	* *For loop.*
	* *While loop.* 
	* *Switch.*
	* *If Else.*
	
### How the verify if its a valid credit card or not?

The Luhn algorithm starts by the end of the number, from the last right digit to the first left digit.
 Multiplying by 2 all digits of even rank. If the double of a digit is equal or superior to 10, 
 replace it by the sum of its digits. Realize the sum s s of all digits found. The control digit 
c is equal to  **c=(10 - (s mod 10 ) mod 10)**
